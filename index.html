                                I am a Computer Games Development Graduate with a focus in Unreal Engine and Engine Development in C++.<br>
                                I Gradutated with a First Class in 2024 with my final project being creating a Physics and Collision Detection Engine in C++<br>
                                I am currently applying for jobs in both the computer games industry and software development. While working on projects and expanding on 
                                my skills set. My main project at the moment is to expand on my Physics Engine to incoporate better graphics and post-processing techniques.
                                <br><br>
                                Outside of Game Development, I have a job for bouldering where I was apart of a society they did climbing and other outdoors activities 
                                on a regular basis which I continue to do.
